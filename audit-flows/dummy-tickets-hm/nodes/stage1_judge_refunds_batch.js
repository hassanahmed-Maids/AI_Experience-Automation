// Pacing (§1) bounds requests per second. The pre-flight gate (§3) bounds how many there

// Classify one response item. Works on THREE different shapes, because which one arrives
// depends on how the HTTP node was configured and on how it failed:
//   - a normal parsed body (responseFormat: json)          -> ok, unless it is an error body
//   - an ERP error body (Spring shape: status/error/path)  -> classified by `status`
//   - an n8n error object (onError: continueRegularOutput) -> classified by scanning its text,
//     because n8n does not put the HTTP code anywhere predictable in it
// Scanning text is crude. It is also the only thing that works across all three, and a
// classifier that only understood the tidy shape would report a healthy run while ERP burned.

  // A BARE THREE-DIGIT SCAN MUST NOT BE POINTED AT A SUCCESSFUL BODY, and for a long time it
  // was. `has('503')` matched anywhere in the item's JSON, so a healthy response classified as
  // a server error the moment its DATA happened to contain those digits - a contract id of 503,
  // an id of 1502, or an amount of 5040, which is not hypothetical: 5040 is a real price on the
  // CC price card. Stage 2 ships per-contract payloads full of ids and amounts, so five
  // consecutive ordinary contracts could trip the breaker against a perfectly healthy ERP.
  //
  // That is the crying-wolf failure this file warns about elsewhere, and the reaction to a
  // spurious trip is to raise the thresholds until it stops - at which point it detects nothing.
  //
  // So the bare digits are scanned ONLY over the error region: what n8n puts under `error`, and
  // a top-level string `message`. The distinctive PHRASES stay on the full text, because they do
  // not appear in id data and they are what catches a Spring error body nested under `body` -
  // the one shape where the status code is not reachable as a number.

// This node exists ONLY to judge the batch and hand it on unchanged. The alternative was to put
// the breaker at the top of Build Evidence Bundle - a generated 10 KB block pasted into it
// would have made the interesting code the minority of that file, and
// every future reader would scroll past the part that matters. A node whose whole job is the
// breaker says what it is from the canvas.
//
// WHAT CAN AND CANNOT FIRE HERE, stated rather than implied:
//   consecutive_failures  - LIVE. Five 5xx/429/timeouts in a row abort the run.
//   degraded_rate         - CONDITIONAL. It needs 20 samples, and this batch is one call per
//                           case SELECTED FOR THE VERIFIER, not per transaction - a quiet month
//                           can be well under 20, in which case only the consecutive rule is
//                           watching. That is the honest position, not a gap to paper over:
//                           with 5 consecutive failures out of a batch of 12 the run aborts.
//   latency               - CANNOT FIRE, and that is not a defect. The rule compares this batch
//                           against a baseline taken from an EARLIER batch of the same key in
//                           the same run, and Get All-Time Refunds fans out over the selected
//                           cases exactly once - there is no second batch to compare to.
//                           erp_t0 is therefore not stamped and `baseline_carried` logs false.
//                           Said out loud because a latency check that silently never fires is
